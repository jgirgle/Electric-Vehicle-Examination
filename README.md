# Electric-Vehicle-Examination

Project Description:

Our objective is to crack down on environmental issues and see if there is a broad correlation between electric vehicle sales and the change in natural gas emissions in California. To do this we will examine electric car data, specifically car sales, across a 10 year period in California, and natural gas emissions (Carbon Monoxide and Methane) data for the same time period and location. 

Research Questions: 
1. What has been the yearly increase of electric vehicles introduced into the California market from 2009 - 2018?
2. What are the yearly carbon monoxide emission levels for California from 2009 - 2018?
3. What are the yearly methane emission levels for California from 2009 - 2018?
4. Is there a correlation between the use of electric vehicles and carbon monoxide levels? 
5. Is there a correlation between the use of electric vehicles and methane levels? 
6. By examining electric vehicles and the two chosen emissions, has the introduction of electric vehicles into the california market made an improvement on the air quality?
